# Project Ideas

## 1. Basic NLP Project: Sentiment Analysis + NER Web App
**Difficulty:** ⭐ (Beginner)  
**Skills/Tools:**  
- HuggingFace (Transformers)
- SpaCy/NLTK (NER, POS Tagging)
- Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- Streamlit (for UI)  

**Project Idea:**  
Build a web app where users input text (e.g., a tweet or review), and the model returns:
- Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
- Extracted entities (People, Organizations, Locations)  
Deploy using Streamlit or Flask.  

**Why?**  
- Demonstrates foundational NLP skills.
- Easy to extend (e.g., add POS tagging).

## 2. Intermediate: AI-Powered Resume Parser with RAG
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ (Intermediate)  
**Skills/Tools:**  
- LangChain, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Pinecone/ChromaDB (Vector DB)
- SpaCy (NER for extracting skills/experience)  

**Project Idea:**  
Build a system that:
1. Takes a resume (PDF) and extracts skills, experience, and education (NER).
2. Uses RAG to match job descriptions (stored in Pinecone/ChromaDB) with the resume.
3. Generates a "fit score" and suggests improvements.  

**Why?**  
- Shows real-world AI application (HR tech).
- Combines NLP + RAG + Vector DBs.

## 3. Advanced: Custom AI Chatbot with Document Retrieval
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)  
**Skills/Tools:**  
- LangChain + Flowise (Low-code LLM orchestration)
- Pinecone/ChromaDB (for document storage)
- HuggingFace (LLM fine-tuning, if needed)  

**Project Idea:**  
Build a domain-specific chatbot (e.g., legal, medical, or tech support) that:
- Ingests PDFs (e.g., research papers, manuals).
- Uses RAG to fetch relevant answers.
- Deploy via Flowise (UI) or FastAPI.  

**Why?**  
- Proves end-to-end LLM application skills.
- Uses RAG + Vector DBs + LangChain (key for AI Engineer roles).

## 4. Expert: Automated Workflow for AI Content Moderation
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Expert)  
**Skills/Tools:**  
- n8n (workflow automation)
- HuggingFace (fine-tuned toxicity classifier)
- Pinecone (store flagged content)  

**Project Idea:**  
Create an automated moderation system that:
1. Scans social media posts/comments (via API).
2. Uses a fine-tuned HuggingFace model to detect toxic content.
3. Flags & stores harmful content in Pinecone.
4. Triggers alerts (Slack/Email) via n8n.  

**Why?**  
- Shows real-time AI + automation (valuable in production systems).
- Combines NLP + workflow tools (n8n) + DBs.

## Bonus: Fine-tune a Domain-Specific LLM
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Advanced)  
**Skills/Tools:**  
- HuggingFace (LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning)
- LangChain (for downstream tasks)  

**Project Idea:**  
Fine-tune a small LLM (e.g., Mistral-7B) on a custom dataset (e.g., medical Q&A, legal docs).  
Deploy it with a simple API (FastAPI) and compare performance vs. base model.  

**Why?**  
- Proves deep LLM expertise (key for AI Engineer roles).

## Final Tips:
✔ Deploy projects (use Streamlit, Flask, or HuggingFace Spaces).  
✔ Write blogs explaining your approach (helps in interviews).  
✔ Use GitHub with good documentation (READMEs, demos).
